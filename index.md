Hi,

My name is Matthias Schmidtblaicher. I work at [QuantCo](https://www.quantco.com/), where we develop data-driven algorithms for pricing, forecasting, and claims management.

My dissertation at the EUI, under the supervision of [Peter Hansen](https://sites.google.com/site/peterreinhardhansen/), focused on econometric methods for time series data. I examined inference about present value models and developed models that measure vaccine compliance.
