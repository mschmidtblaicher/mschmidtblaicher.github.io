Hi,

My name is Matthias Schmidtblaicher. I work at [QuantCo](https://www.quantco.com/). I received my PhD in economics in 2020 from the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics), where I was awarded the Vilfredo Pareto prize for best dissertation.

Here are a few things that I've enjoyed working on:

- Building and deploying a pricing algorithm for a multi-billion annual revenue product.
- Leading a data science team for a large-scale migration project.
- Contributing to a fast and user-friendly [open-source GLM package](https://github.com/Quantco/glum).
- Creating the [first high-frequency model of vaccine compliance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2019.1623045) and using it to assess the harmful effects of fake news.

You can access my CV by following [this link](/cv/cv.pdf), which also contains my contact information. For information about working at QuantCo, please visit our [Notion site](https://quantco.notion.site/Job-Opportunities-at-QuantCo-7443e41846d14bb9bd1dc84743b629d0).

I occasionally add notes about interesting things in statistics, economics, or software here. You can also find information about my previous academic activities with the amazing [Peter Hansen](https://reinhardhansen.github.io/).
